\title{Process building vectors: clip, ID, split}
\usage{
process_lod2(buildings, aoi, target_epsg = 25832)
}
\arguments{
\item{buildings}{An \code{sf} object containing building polygons.}

\item{aoi}{An \code{sf} or \code{sfc} object defining the area of interest.}

\item{target_epsg}{Target CRS EPSG code (default: 25832).}
}
\value{
A named list with elements \code{buildings} and \code{bridges}
(both \code{sf} objects with geometry normalized to MULTIPOLYGON).
}
\description{
Clips building polygons to an AOI, assigns sequential IDs,
and splits the dataset into buildings and bridges according
to the ALKIS function code. Handles polyhedral geometries
(e.g., from CityGML LOD2) with automatic conversion fallbacks.
}
\details{
If input contains unsupported geometry types (POLYHEDRALSURFACE, TIN):
\enumerate{
\item Attempts per-feature extraction to polygons
\item Tries GDAL vectortranslate as fallback
\item Provides clear error with conversion instructions if all fail
}
}
